# Release Notes

## 0.6.x

### 0.6.2

* Added for for writing GeoTIFFs from RasterFrames via with DataFrameWriter.
* Added `spark.read.geotrellis.withNumPartitions(Int)` for setting the initial number of partitions to use when reading a layer.
* Added `spark.read.geotrellis.withTileSubdivisions(Int)` for evenly subdividing tiles before they become rows in a RasterFrame.
* Added `astraea.spark.rasterframes.util.debug` hosting debug feature to export RasterFrame as a slippy-tile directory structure.
  _Experimental and not for long-term use_.
* _Change_: Default interpoation for `toRaster` and `toMultibandRaster` has been changed from `Bilinear` to `NearestNeighbor`.
* _Breaking_: Renamed/moved `astraea.spark.rasterframes.functions.CellStatsAggregateFunction.Statistics` to
`astraea.spark.rasterframes.stats.CellStatistics`.
* _Breaking_: `HistogramAggregateFunction` now generates a `astraea.spark.rasterframes.stats.CellHistogram`.

  
### 0.6.1

* Added support for reading striped GeoTiffs (#64).
* Moved extension methods associated with querying tagged columns to `DataFrameMethods` for supporting
  temporal and spatial columns on non-RasterFrame DataFrames.
* GeoTIFF and GeoTrellis DataSources automatically initialize RasterFrames.
* Added `RasterFrame.toMultibandRaster`.
* Added utility for rendering multiband tile as RGB composite PNG.
* Added `RasterFrame.withRFColumnRenamed` to lessen boilerplate in maintaining `RasterFrame` type tag.  

### 0.6.0

* Upgraded to Spark 2.2.1. Added `VersionShims` to allow for Spark 2.1.x backwards compatibility.
* Introduced separate `rasterframes-datasource` library for hosting sources from which to read RasterFrames.
* Implemented basic (but sufficient) temporal and spatial filter predicate push-down feature for the GeoTrellis layer datasource.
* Added Catalyst expressions specifically for spatial relations, allowing for some polymorphism over JTS types.
* Added a GeoTrellis Catalog `DataSource` for inspecting available layers and associated metadata at a URI 
* Added GeoTrellis Layer DataSource for reading GeoTrellis layers from any SPI-registered GeoTrellis backend (which includes HDFS, S3, Accumulo, HBase, Cassandra, etc.).
* Ability to save a RasterFrame as a GeoTrellis layer to any SPI-registered GeoTrellis backends. Multi-column RasterFrames are written as Multiband tiles.
* Addd a GeoTiff DataSource for directly loading a (preferably Cloud Optimized) GeoTiff as a RasterFrame, each row containing tiles as they are internally organized.
* Fleshed out support for `MultibandTile` and `TileFeature` support in datasource.
* Added typeclass for specifying merge operations on `TileFeature` data payload.
* Added `withTemporalComponent` convenince method for creating appending a temporal key column with constant value.
* _Breaking_: Renamed `withExtent` to `withBounds`, and now returns a JTS `Polygon`.
* Added `EnvelopeEncoder` for encoding JTS `Envelope` type. 
* Refactored build into separate `core` and `docs`, paving way for `pyrasterframes` polyglot module.
* Added utility extension method `withPrefixedColumnNames` to `DataFrame`.

#### Known Issues
* Writing multi-column RasterFrames to GeoTrellis layers requires all tiles to be of the same cell type.

## 0.5.x

### 0.5.12

* Added `withSpatialIndex` to introduce a column assigning a z-curve index value based on the tile's centroid in EPSG:4326. 
* Added column-appending convenience methods: `withExtent`, `withCenter`,  `withCenterLatLng`
* Documented example of creating a GeoTrellis layer from a RasterFrame.
* Added Spark 2.2.0 forward-compatibility.
* Upgraded to GeoTrellis 1.2.0-RC2.

### 0.5.11

* Significant performance improvement in `explodeTiles` (1-2 orders of magnitude). See [#38](https://github.com/s22s/raster-frames/issues/38)
* Fixed bugs in `NoData` handling when converting to `Double` tiles.

### 0.5.10

* Upgraded to shapeless 2.3.2
* Fixed [#36](https://github.com/s22s/raster-frames/issues/36), [#37](https://github.com/s22s/raster-frames/issues/37)

### 0.5.9

* Ported to sbt 1.0.3
* Added sbt-generated `astraea.spark.rasterframes.RFBuildInfo`
* Fixed bug in computing `aggMean` when one or more tiles are `null` 
* Deprecated `rfIinit` in favor of `SparkSession.withRasterFrames` or `SQLContext.withRasterFrames` extension methods

### 0.5.8

* Upgraded to GeoTrellis 1.2.0-RC1
* Added [`REPLsent`-based](https://github.com/marconilanna/REPLesent) tour of RasterFrames
* Moved Giter8 template to separate repository `s22s/raster-frames.g8` due to sbt limitations
* Updated _Getting Started_ to reference new Giter8 repo
* Changed SQL function name `rf_stats` and `rf_histogram` to `rf_aggStats` and `rf_aggHistogram` 
  for consistency with DataFrames API

### 0.5.7

* Created faster implementation of aggregate statistics.
* Fixed bug in deserialization of `TileUDT`s originating from `ConstantTile`s
* Fixed bug in serialization of `NoDataFilter` within SparkML pipeline
* Refactoring of UDF organization
* Various documentation tweaks and updates
* Added Giter8 template

### 0.5.6

* `TileUDF`s are encoded using directly into Catalyst--without Kryo--resulting in an insane
 decrease in serialization time for small tiles (`int8`, <= 128Â²), and pretty awesome speedup for
 all other cell types other than `float32` (marginal slowing). While not measured, memory 
 footprint is expected to have gone down.


### 0.5.5

* `aggStats` and `tileMean` functions rewritten to compute simple statistics directly rather than using `StreamingHistogram`
* `tileHistogramDouble` and `tileStatsDouble` were replaced by `tileHistogram` and `tileStats`
* Added `tileSum`, `tileMin` and `tileMax` functions 
* Added `aggMean`, `aggDataCells` and `aggNoDataCells` aggregate functions.
* Added `localAggDataCells` and `localAggNoDataCells` cell-local (tile generating) fuctions
* Added `tileToArray` and `arrayToTile`
* Overflow fix in `LocalStatsAggregateFunction`

# RasterFrames

_RasterFrames™_ brings the power of Spark DataFrames to geospatial raster data, empowered by the map algebra and tile layer 
operations of [GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io/). 

The source code can be found on GitHub at [s22s/raster-frames](https://github.com/s22s/raster-frames).

The underlying purpose of RasterFrames™ is to allow data scientists and software developers to process
and analyze geospatial-temporal raster data with the same flexibility and ease as any other Spark Catalyst data type. At its
core is a user-defined type (UDT) called @scaladoc[`TileUDT`](org.apache.spark.sql.gt.types.TileUDT), 
which encodes a GeoTrellis @scaladoc[`Tile`](geotrellis.raster.Tile) in a form the Spark Catalyst engine can process. 
Furthermore, we extend the definition of a DataFrame to encompass some additional invariants, allowing for geospatial 
operations within and between RasterFrames to occur, while still maintaining necessary geo-referencing constructs.
